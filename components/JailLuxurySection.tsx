              The name **"Jail" is more than just a brand**. It's a nod to our
              roots. The original shop was located on Jail Road in Banka, and the name
              was born out of the simplicity of direction "Jail
              Road, Jail Road." Today, it stands as a symbol of
              our journey, from a small shop in Bihar to a
              **luxury brand** that resonates with customers
              around the world.
